# MiniMine

We decided on using libGDX now (it works on a higher abstraction level than LWJGL but uses it as basis).
libGDX create a Cube: https://xoppa.github.io/blog/basic-3d-using-libgdx/ 
libGDX shader tutorial: https://xoppa.github.io/blog/creating-a-shader-with-libgdx/

We are currently working on rendering a chunk (setup of the rendering system etc).

##Set up the project:
1. Download the project with your preffered git client (for example SourceTree works very well https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ ).
2. Make sure you have Eclipse Neon installed (Gradle is already integrated in the IDE and works much better than in the eclipse versions before).
3. Import the project as a Gradle project into your workspace (not as a git project!!! it won't build a valid Gradle project then).
