# MiniMine

We decided on using libGDX now (it works on a higher abstraction level than LWJGL but uses it as basis).
libGDX create a Cube: https://xoppa.github.io/blog/basic-3d-using-libgdx/ 
libGDX shader tutorial: https://xoppa.github.io/blog/creating-a-shader-with-libgdx/

We are currently working on rendering a chunk (setup of the rendering system etc).
